    This class implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier for classification tasks.

    Parameters:
        k (int, optional): The number of nearest neighbors to consider for classification. Defaults to 1.
        vectorized (bool, optional): If True, use vectorized calculations for distance computation
        for faster execution. Defaults to False.

    Attributes:
        k (int): The number of nearest neighbors to consider for classification.
        vectorized (bool): Indicates whether vectorized calculations for distance computation are enabled.
        X_train (numpy.ndarray or None): The training data features.
        y_train (numpy.ndarray or None): The training data labels.

    Raises:
